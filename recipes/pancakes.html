        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 eggs</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>5 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>5 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>5 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt (Optional)</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, butter and 
                buttermilk. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda 
                and sugar; stir into the wet ingredients just until blended. 
                Adjust the thickness of the batter to your liking by adding more 
                flour or buttermilk if necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking 
                spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook 
                until bubbles appear on the surface. Flip with a spatula, and 
                cook until browned on the other side. Continue with remaining 
                batter.
            </li>
        </ol>
